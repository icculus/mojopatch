# MojoPatch

A standalone tool for updating applications in the field.

This was a crucial piece of infrastructure to me, back when people
would install a video game off a disc, and then later manually
download patches for that game.

This was used for several Mac OS X titles I worked on. This code
would likely need some updates for modern systems (it used the
Carbon API, which is a giant no-no in these later years, for
example), and with some small effort could likely target Windows
and Linux as well.

But in an age of broadband, package managers and app stores, it's
not clear to me any maintenance on this package is worthwhile now.

If you need it, though, feel free to steal what's useful. And I
will always accept good patches.
