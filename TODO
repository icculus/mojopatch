- md5sum of patchfile itself?
- Move confirm() to UI abstraction.
- Integrate xdelta into single binary?
- Lots of tests for dir/notdir or file/notfile...no symlinks support, etc.
- serialization of patchfile.
- Standardize datatypes.
- Make everything fit in 80 columns...
- Split mojopatch.c into multiple files.
- Get other platforms besides Mac updated and building again.
- Look for FIXMEs...
- "_fatal" isn't really appropriate anymore, since it might not be fatal.
- We md5sum to compare files. A byte-by-byte compare that halts as soon as
  there's a difference would be much faster when creating the initial patch
  files.
